### Hello
I'm an hybrid mobile software developer, working mainly with Flutter and Django (or alternatively RN/React and dotnet).
I've also worked 6 years writing software for image/audio recognition, using C#, C++ and OpenCV.

### Current Project
I'm currently developing an Behavioral Management Program app for [Instituto Biodelta](https://biodelta.com.br) using Flutter and Django. The methodology already existed and has been in use by the client to keep track of KPIs regarding their employees performance at work; the client uses a mix of Google Forms, Google Sheets and Excel to collect and analyze the data, this has served as base to model the database and stablish the use cases and API endpoints. The client-side code is available for now in [here](https://github.com/ericomine/pgc_app), back-end code is closed source.

### Pet Project ðŸ¦’
I'm currently working on a Non-Violent Communication journaling app, using Flutter. It's called Giraffe (which is the NVC mascot) and it's meant to help users learn and practice NVC daily. Source code is in [here](https://github.com/ericomine/giraffe-app), still in early stages.
