### Hello
I'm an hybrid mobile software developer, working mainly with Flutter and Django (or alternatively RN/React and dotnet).
I've also worked 6 years writing software for image/audio recognition, using C#, C++ and OpenCV.

### void main() =>
I'm currently working fulltime as a Flutter Developer at @codehashi.

### Side Gig
I'm currently developing an Behavioral Management Program app for [Instituto Biodelta](https://biodelta.com.br) using Flutter, Django and Figma prototypes. This should replace a series of spreadsheets. I have currently closed the source code.

### Pet Project ðŸ¦’
I'm currently working on a Non-Violent Communication journaling app, using Flutter. It's called Giraffe (which is the NVC mascot) and it's meant to help users learn and practice NVC daily. Source code is in [here](https://github.com/ericomine/giraffe-app), still in early stages.
