### Hello

Before this, I also worked for more than 5yrs with C#, C++, and Python, accumulating plenty of knowledge of OOP and Software Engineering in different contexts and stacks. I've also owned my own business and worked with research and strategic planning. Due to my wide range of professional experiences and interests, I also have very assertive and empathetic communication skills.
