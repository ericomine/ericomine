### Hello
I'm a hybrid mobile software developer, working mainly with Flutter and Django (or alternatively RN/React and dotnet).
I've also worked 6 years writing software for image/audio recognition, using C#, C++ and OpenCV.

### Pet Project ðŸ¦’
I'm currently working on a Non-Violent Communication journaling app, using Flutter. It's called Giraffe (which is the NVC mascot) and it's meant to help users learn and practice NVC daily. Source code is in [here](https://github.com/ericomine/giraffe-app), still in early stages.

### âš¡ Fun facts:
- I'm a Buddhist,
- I've worked 2 years with woodworking,
- I love bicycles, all kinds of bikes ðŸš´,
- I have an EE degree from [USP](http://usp.br),
- http://pronoun.is/he
